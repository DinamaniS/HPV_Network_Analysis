🧬 Virus–Host Network Topology Analysis (HPV16 & HPV18)
Overview

This repository contains reproducible Python scripts and data files for analyzing the topological architecture of bipartite virus–host protein interaction networks.
The workflow computes both global and node-level metrics to uncover structural features such as network heterogeneity, centralization, hub dominance, and community organization for HPV16 and HPV18 virus–host systems.

🔍 Objectives

Quantify network heterogeneity (nh) and network centralization (nc) to evaluate non-random, hub-centric topology.

Compute advanced node-level measures, including degree-based and centrality-based indices, to identify functionally important proteins.

Evaluate clustering patterns and community structure (modularity-based) within bipartite virus–host networks.

Compare the real network’s structural organization against Erdős–Rényi random networks of equal size to confirm biological significance.
