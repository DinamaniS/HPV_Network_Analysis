# HPV_Network_Analysis

This repository contains a Python-based pipeline for analyzing virus-host protein interaction networks of **HPV16** and **HPV18**, two major strains involved in **cervical cancer**. The workflow computes network topological properties, visualizes heterogeneity and centralization, identifies key viral hubs, and extracts host protein lists for enrichment analysis (e.g., Metascape).


## 📌 Features

- 📊 Builds interaction networks using NetworkX
- 🧠 Computes **network heterogeneity** and **centralization**
- 🔁 Generates **random networks** for statistical comparison
- 📈 Visualizes network metrics via bar plots
- 🎯 Identifies **top viral proteins** by degree
- 📤 Exports host protein lists for downstream analysis (e.g., Metascape)
